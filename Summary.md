## 1. Exploring stem cell biology with large-scale single cell transcriptomics
Stem cells are inherently lowly abundant in tissues. To characterize transient states of skeletal muscle stem cells, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing data from >365k single cells and nuclei and mined the resulting compendium for committed muscle stem cells.

## 2. Expanding spatial transcriptomics into the world of noncoding RNAs
Current spatial transcriptomics technologies only capture RNAs which have poly(A) tails and thus overlook the wealth of information in the non-A-tailed portion of the transcriptome. Spatial Total RNA-Sequencing (STRS) circumvents this problem by polyadenylating RNAs in situ prior to hybridization.
