<!-- ## **About**:
I'm a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Cornell, co-advised by [Ben Cosgrove](https://cosgrovelab.bme.cornell.edu/) and [Iwijn De Vlaminck](https://devlaminck.bme.cornell.edu/). I work on computational and molecular strategies to understand single-cell and spatial biology, with particular interests in stem cells and noncoding RNAs.

Before coming to Cornell, I received my BS in Biomedical Engineering (minor in Biology) from Georgia Tech. While there I also worked in [Manu Platt's](https://platt.gatech.edu/index.html) lab on proteolytic networks. After undergrad, I moved to the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, MD and worked in [Paul Liu's lab](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Paul-P-Liu-MD-PhD). In the Liu Lab, I worked on developing in vitro models for familial leukemia using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. -->
