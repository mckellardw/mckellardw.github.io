### About:
I'm a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Cornell, co-advised by [Ben Cosgrove](https://cosgrovelab.bme.cornell.edu/) and [Iwijn De Vlaminck](https://devlaminck.bme.cornell.edu/). I work on computational and molecular strategies to understand single-cell and spatial biology, with a particular interest in stem cells and noncoding RNAs.
