## **About**:
I'm a PhD candidate in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Cornell, co-advised by [Ben Cosgrove](https://cosgrovelab.bme.cornell.edu/) and [Iwijn De Vlaminck](https://devlaminck.bme.cornell.edu/). I work on computational and molecular strategies to understand single-cell and spatial biology, with particular interests in stem cells and noncoding RNAs.

Before coming to Cornell, I received my BS in Biomedical Engineering (minor in Biology) from Georgia Tech. While there I also worked in [Manu Platt's lab](https://platt.gatech.edu/index.html) on proteolytic networks. After undergrad, I moved to the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, MD and worked in [Paul Liu's lab](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Paul-P-Liu-MD-PhD). In the Liu Lab, I worked on developing in vitro models for familial leukemia using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells.

<!-- ## **Highlights**:
+ My newest first author preprint on a method we call Spatial Total RNA-Sequencing (STRS). STRS enables spatial mapping of noncoding and other non-polyadenylated RNAs in tissue slices: [link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.20.488964v1)
+ My recent first author paper on building a single-cell reference dataset for skeletal muscle regeneration, published in Communications Biology: [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02810-x)
+ Highlight from the BME Department at Cornell: [link](https://www.bme.cornell.edu/spotlights/david-mckellar-phd-student) -->
